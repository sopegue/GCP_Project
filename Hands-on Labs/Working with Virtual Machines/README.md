# Working with Virtual Machines

## Overview

In this lab, you set up a game application — a Minecraft server.

The Minecraft server software will run on a Compute Engine instance.

You use an n1-standard-1 machine type that includes a 10-GB boot disk, 1 virtual CPU (vCPU), and 3.75 GB of RAM. This machine type runs Debian Linux by default.

To make sure there is plenty of room for the Minecraft server's world data, you also attach a high-performance 50-GB persistent solid-state drive (SSD) to the instance. This dedicated Minecraft server can support up to 50 players.

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Customize an application server

- Install and configure necessary software

- Configure network access

- Schedule regular backups
