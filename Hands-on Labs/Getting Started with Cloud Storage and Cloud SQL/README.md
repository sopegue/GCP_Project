# Getting Started with Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL

## Overview

In this lab, you create a Cloud Storage bucket and place an image in it. You'll also configure an application running in Compute Engine to use a database managed by Cloud SQL. For this lab, you will configure a web server with PHP, a web development environment that is the basis for popular blogging software. Outside this lab, you will use analogous techniques to configure these packages.

You also configure the web server to reference the image in the Cloud Storage bucket.

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Create a Cloud Storage bucket and place an image into it.

- Create a Cloud SQL instance and configure it.

- Connect to the Cloud SQL instance from a web server.

- Use the image in the Cloud Storage bucket on a web page.
